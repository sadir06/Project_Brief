# Overview

This repository contains our team’s complete implementation of an RV32I processor, developed progressively across several milestones and maintained across multiple branches for clarity and traceability. The project began with a fully working single-cycle CPU that implemented the core RV32I instruction subset. Building on this foundation, we extended the design into a five-stage pipelined processor that supported complete forwarding and hazard-detection logic, enabling correct resolution of data hazards, load–use dependencies, and control-flow changes due to branches and jumps. The final stage of development introduced a realistic 4 KiB, two-way set-associative write-back data cache, bringing the design closer to modern processor memory hierarchies by supporting tag checks across both ways, dirty and valid tracking, LRU replacement, and multi-cycle miss handling integrated with the pipeline’s stall signals.

# Repo Structure

Our repository is organised into multiple branches that each correspond to one major stage of the project: the single-cycle processor, the pipelined implementation of it, then cached pipelined, and finally the full RV32I instruction-complete implementation. We also worked on our individual branches to not disrupt the whole project we were working on. Once one person completed their section and the team was happy with their implementation, we created PRs and merged with main.

For easy testing, we created new branches with the final commit of a specific section in it. For example, in the "Single-Cycle-RV32I-Implementation", we placed the final commit that had the fully implemented single cycle CPU (without the pipelining/cache).

## Single Cycle RV32I Implementation

The branch "Single-Cycle-RV32I-Implementation" contains our initial single-cycle RV32I CPU implementing the basic subset of instructions required

**Instructions Implemented:**
- R-type: `ADD`, `SUB`, `SLL`, `SLT`, `SLTU`, `XOR`, `SRL`, `SRA`, `OR`, `AND`
- I-type (ALU): `ADDI`, `SLTI`, `SLTIU`, `XORI`, `ORI`, `ANDI`, `SLLI`, `SRLI`, `SRAI`
- I-type (Load): `LBU`, `LB`, `LH`, `LW`, `LHU`
- I-type (Jump): `JALR`
- S-type: `SB`, `SH`, `SW`
- B-type: `BEQ`, `BNE`, `BLT`, `BGE`, `BLTU`, `BGEU`
- U-type: `LUI`
- J-type: `JAL`

├── register_file.sv
└── top.sv
```

## Stretch goal 1: Pipelined RV32I Implementation

The branch "Pipelined-RV32I-Implementation" introduces our full 5-stage pipeline (IF → ID → EX → MEM → WB), hazard detection, forwarding, and pipeline registers. It still uses the basic instruction subset and a direct memory module without caching.

Directory structure:
```

│   ├── exe_mem_reg.sv
│   ├── execute.sv
│   ├── forward_unit.sv
│   ├── hazard_unit.sv

│   ├── pc_reg.sv
│   └── register_file.sv
└── single_cycle/
    ├── datapath.sv
    └── top.sv
```

**Key Additions:**
- Pipeline registers for each stage (IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB)
- Hazard detection unit for load-use hazards
- Forwarding unit for data hazards (EX-to-EX, MEM-to-EX forwarding)
- Pipeline flushing mechanism for control hazards
- Proper multicycle control signal propagation

## Stretch goal 2: Memory Cached Pipelined RV32I

For this branch "Memory-Cached-Pipelined-RV32I", we kept the 5-stage pipeline from the previous milestone and added a real cache subsystem to replace the simple data memory.

Directory structure:
```
rtl/
├── pipelined/
│   ├── exe_mem_reg.sv
│   ├── execute.sv
│   ├── forward_unit.sv
│   ├── hazard_unit.sv
│   ├── id_ex_reg.sv
│   ├── if_id_reg.sv
│   ├── mem_wb_reg.sv
│   ├── pc_reg_pipe.sv
│   ├── tb_execute.sv
│   └── top_pipelined.sv
├── shared/
│   ├── alu.sv
│   ├── control_unit.sv
│   ├── data_cache.sv
│   ├── data_mem.sv
│   ├── extend.sv
│   ├── instr_mem.sv
│   ├── pc_reg.sv
│   └── register_file.sv
└── single_cycle/
    ├── datapath.sv
    └── top.sv
```

**Major Additions:**
- 4 KiB 2-way set-associative write-back cache (128 sets, 16-byte lines)
- Tag, valid, and dirty bit arrays for both ways
- LRU bit per set for replacement policy
- Multi-cycle miss handling with automatic stall propagation
- Cache-aware hazard unit modifications
- Shadow registers for handling misses during pipeline operation

**Cache Specifications:**
- Total size: 4 KiB
- Associativity: 2-way set-associative
- Line size: 16 bytes (4 words)
- Number of sets: 128
- Tag bits: 21 bits
- Index bits: 7 bits
- Offset bits: 4 bits

This branch integrates a realistic memory subsystem that significantly increases realism and complexity. Adding a cache required additional stall pathways, dirty-bit handling, proper line fill behaviour, and full tag/index/offset decomposition. This significantly increased realism and complexity compared to the earlier pipeline.

## Stretch goal 3: Full Instruction Set

Finally in the brache "Full-Instruction-Set-(Final-CPU)/main" is our final, fully functional processor supporting the entire RV32I base ISA (except ECALL/EBREAK/CSR/FENCE). All pipeline, hazard, forwarding, and cache features are integrated and passing all reference tests.

Directory structure:
```
rtl/
├── pipelined/
│   ├── exe_mem_reg.sv
│   ├── execute.sv
│   ├── forward_unit.sv
│   ├── hazard_unit.sv
│   ├── id_ex_reg.sv
│   ├── if_id_reg.sv
│   ├── mem_wb_reg.sv
│   ├── pc_reg_pipe.sv
│   ├── tb_execute.sv
│   └── top_pipelined.sv
├── shared/
│   ├── alu.sv
│   ├── control_unit.sv

│   ├── pc_reg.sv
│   └── register_file.sv
└── single_cycle/
    ├── datapath.sv
    └── top.sv
```

This is our final and most complete design. Here we extended the instruction set to include all RV32I ALU, load/store, branch, and shift operations, and we fixed all pipeline/control/cache interactions until every test case passed. This branch represents the culmination of all architectural, verification, and debugging work.

## Our design decision:

The diagram above shows our complete processor architecture with all components integrated, including the pipelined datapath, hazard detection and forwarding units, and the two-way set-associative cache.

# Verification & Testing

Our processor underwent extensive verification through multiple testing approaches to ensure correctness across all implementations.

## Test Suite Overview

We developed and utilized 15 comprehensive assembly test programs:

### Provided Tests (1-5)
1. **1_addi_bne.s** - Basic ADDI and BNE instructions
2. **2_li_add.s** - Load immediate and ADD operations
3. **3_lbu_sb.s** - Load byte unsigned and store byte
4. **4_jal_ret.s** - JAL and JALR (function calls and returns)
5. **5_pdf.s** - Probability density function calculation (1M+ cycles)

### Extended Instruction Set Tests (10-15)
Created to verify full RV32I implementation:
- **10_memory_offsets.s** - Load/store with various offsets
- **11_bitwise.s** - XOR, OR, AND, XORI, ORI, ANDI operations
- **12_shifts.s** - SLL, SRL, SRA, SLLI, SRLI, SRAI instructions
- **13_store_halfwords.s** - Halfword store operations
- **14_branches.s** - All branch types (BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU)
- **15_comparisons.s** - SLT, SLTU, SLTI, SLTIU instructions

### Cache-Specific Tests (8-9)
Written to verify cache behavior:
- **8_cache_hit.s** - Repeated loads to verify cache hits
- **9_cache_miss_set_conflict.s** - Set conflicts and eviction behavior

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing
Our automated test framework uses Verilator for simulation:
- Compiles SystemVerilog RTL to C++ model
- Runs each test program for specified cycles (typically 10,000)
- Validates output register `a0` against expected values
- Generates waveforms (`.vcd`) for debugging
- Produces disassembly (`.dis`) for verification

All tests are executed via shell scripts:
```bash
./doit.sh              # Runs all tests on single-cycle
./doit2.sh             # Runs all tests and compares single vs. pipelined
./doit2.sh pipelined   # Runs all tests on pipelined only
```

### Visual Verification with VBuddy
Two demonstration programs run on VBuddy hardware:

**F1 Starting Lights:**
- Implements F1 starting sequence with 8 LEDs
- Pattern: 2^n + 1 (1 → 3 → 7 → 15 → 31 → 63 → 127 → 255)
- Enhanced version includes LFSR-based random delays using XOR feedback
- Demonstrates branches, subroutines, and sequential logic

**PDF (Probability Density Function):**
- Plots three distributions: Gaussian, Noisy, Triangle
- Processes data from memory (256 values)
- Displays results on VBuddy screen
- Tests load operations, memory access, and arithmetic

### Waveform Analysis
Used GTKWave extensively for:
- Cache state machine verification
- Pipeline stall signal propagation
- Forwarding path validation
- Branch flush behavior
- Multi-cycle operations timing

## Test Results

All 15 assembly tests pass successfully on:
- Single-cycle implementation
- Pipelined implementation
- Cached pipelined implementation
- Full RV32I implementation

**Example Test Output:**
```
[PASS] 1_addi_bne      - Expected: 254, Got: 254
[PASS] 2_li_add        - Expected: 1000, Got: 1000
[PASS] 3_lbu_sb        - Expected: 300, Got: 300
[PASS] 4_jal_ret       - Expected: 53, Got: 53
[PASS] 5_pdf           - Expected: 15363, Got: 15363
[PASS] 8_cache_hit     - Expected: 126, Got: 126
[PASS] 9_cache_miss... - Expected: 300, Got: 300
...
All tests passed!
```

### Known Debug Solutions

During development, we encountered and resolved several critical issues:

1. **Instruction Memory Fetch Issue** - Instructions weren't being fetched properly initially. Fixed by correcting timing in instruction memory module.

2. **Pipeline Register Timing** - Pipeline registers were initially on positive edge, causing read-before-write issues. Changed to negative edge for proper operation.

3. **F1 Lights Blinking** - First LED was blinking unexpectedly. Root cause: pattern calculation done in two operations without temporary register. Fixed by using temp register for atomic updates.

4. **Cache FSM Timing** - Cache state machine timing didn't match memory timing. Resolved through careful state machine redesign and proper clock edge management.

5. **Pipeline Stall Propagation** - Cache misses weren't properly stalling the pipeline. Fixed by adding stall signal to all pipeline registers and implementing shadow registers.

# Design Challenges & Solutions

## Cache Integration
Integrating the 2-way set-associative cache required careful coordination with the pipeline. Key challenges included:
- **Stall Signal Propagation**: Ensuring cache misses properly stalled all pipeline stages without losing instructions
- **Shadow Registers**: Implementing shadow registers to maintain pipeline state during multi-cycle cache operations
- **Write-back Handling**: Managing dirty bit tracking and write-back on eviction

## Pipeline Hazardss
The pipelined implementation required sophisticated hazard handling:
- **Data Hazards**: Implemented forwarding paths from MEM and WB stages to EX stage
- **Load-Use Hazards**: Added stall logic in hazard unit for load-followed-by-use scenarios
- **Control Hazards**: Implemented pipeline flushing for branches and jumps

## Testing Strategy
To ensure comprehensive verification:
- Created modular test scripts that work for both single-cycle and pipelined versions
- Developed cache-specific tests targeting hits, misses, and conflicts
- Standardized test output structure in `tb/test_out/` for consistent file organization
- Used LFSR-based random delays in F1 test to verify complex instruction sequences
